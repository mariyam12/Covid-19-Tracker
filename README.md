# Covid-19-Tracker
It is a website which shows country wise total number of reported covid-19 cases built using spring boot.
To obtain the number of cases reported daily world wide I have used the git hub repository "https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19"
Instead of using rest controller I have used Thymelaeaf to produce http response.
